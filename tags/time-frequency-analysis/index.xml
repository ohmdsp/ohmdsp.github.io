Often, the examples provided in our signal processing textbooks assume that the signal we are working with is wide-sense-stationary. This means that the first and second order statistics (mean and correlation) do not change with shifts in time. Although, all of our statistical signal processing techniques depend upon this statistical behavior in order to produce meaningful characterizations when analyzing a random signal, many real-world signals don&amp;rsquo;t have nonstationary characteristics.</description></item></channel></rss>
