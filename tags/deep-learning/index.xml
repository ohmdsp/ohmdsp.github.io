In this post, I will introduce some basic methods for utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to process spectrograms created from Radio Frequency (RF) data. The information in the post was taken from a tutorial my colleagues and I provided to NVidia Corporation in early 2015 that has been used in their enterprise training series for several years. This post links you to a git project that removes the dependency on Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s DIGITS platform and uses only Keras and Tensorflow.</description></item></channel></rss>
