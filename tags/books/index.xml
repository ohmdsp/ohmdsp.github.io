I will continue to update the list as I discover more treasures. Warning: I primarily like to read non-fiction.
1. Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, by Carlo Rovelli This is a well-written book that is both educational and enjoyable. It is a short book, so it can be read in a weekend. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in modern physics.</description></item></channel></rss>
