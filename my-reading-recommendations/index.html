I will continue to update the list as I discover more treasures. Warning: I primarily like to read non-fiction.</p><p><strong>1. Seven Brief Lessons on Physics</strong>, by Carlo Rovelli<br>This is a well-written book that is both educational and enjoyable. It is a short book, so it can be read in a weekend. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in modern physics.</p><p><strong>2. Reality Is Not What It Seems: The Journey to Quantum Gravity</strong>, by Carlo Rovelli<br>I really enjoyed the background material and physics history presented in this book. It felt like a fresh approach, and the historical connections were very enlightening. The later sections of the book dealing with quantum loop gravity were interesting but less informative than other sections, in my opinion. During one chapter, there is an awkward attempt made to discuss God and religion, which seems hard to resist for physics writers even though it is surely outside their expertise. In summary, this book is worth owning and possibly reading a couple times.</p><p><strong>3. The Signal And The Noise</strong>, by Nate Silver<br>This book is packed with information and stories related to statistical analysis of world events, weather patterns, natural disasters, markets, gambling, etc. I found it to be too wordy throughout so I skimmed through some sections in order to stay interested. However, it is worth reading if you want to know about statistical prediction applied to many different modern history events. If you want to learn about the actual math behind statistical prediction, you will need to get a different book. The sections on games of chance are very interesting.</p><p><strong>4. The Theoretical Minimum</strong>, by Leonard Susskind<br>This is a good book for brushing up on your basic physics. I put it in my re-read list since it never hurts to go over it again. I am looking forward to reading and studying Dr. Susskind&rsquo;s other books on quantum mechanics and relativity. If you have already read Feynman&rsquo;s Lectures on Physics, then this is a good next step.</p><p><strong>5. Thinking Fast and Slow</strong>, by Daniel Kahneman<br>If you like psychology and the study of human decision making, you will likely enjoy this book. I did not find it to be a quick read and for me, it required several weeks to digest piece-by-piece. At times, the book feels like a random assortment of stories and studies, so don&rsquo;t expect an organized narrative. There is a lot of interesting information about human thinking and decision bias presented in the book. It will have you re-evaluating some of your decision making skills.</p><p><strong>6. The Radioactive Boy Scout</strong>, by Ken Silverstein<br>I loved this short book! The story is both inspiring and sad. The book presents a lot of general information about radioactivity and physics in an easy-to-read manner. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in physics or chemistry. It is a great book to share with your teenage son or daughter.</p><p><strong>7. Feynman&rsquo;s Lectures On Physics</strong>, by Richard Feynman<br>I recently revisited these lectures for some self-study. I was reminded how good they are. I will admit, than sometimes the conversations get long and wordy, but Dr. Feynman&rsquo;s thought process is enlightening. Plan to spend many weeks, maybe months, reading/studying these lectures.</p><p><strong>8. Digital Communications</strong>, by Andy Bateman<br>This is meant to be a textbook, but it is short and very well written. I highly recommend this book to any systems engineers looking to get a high-level overview on digital communications. The graphics are also very good.</p><p><strong>9. The Perfectionists</strong>, by Simon Winchester<br>A wonderful book about engineering and precision. I really loved the historical aspect of this book along with stories of impressive engineering.</p><p><strong>10. Astrophysics for People in a Hurry</strong>, by Neil DeGrasse Tyson<br>An informative quick read perfect for a Sunday afternoon. This book contains simple descriptions of important discoveries and concepts around the Cosmic Background Radiation, Dark Matter, Dark Energy, etc. This would be a good book to share with a young student.</p><p><strong>11. Vibrations and Waves in Physics</strong>, by Iian G. Main<br>This book is actually intended as a short textbook for a physics course. However, it is perfect for self-study or refreshing knowlege from your undergraduate physics courses. Keep in mind that a solid understanding of basic physics and differential equations is needed to get the most out of this book.</p><p><strong>12. Feynman Lectures On Computation</strong>, by Richard Feynman<br>This is a fantastic book and a great addition to the lectures listed above. Consider this book a complete introduction to logic operations, encoding and the physics of computation. A book worth reading multiple times.</p><p><strong>13. The Perfectionists</strong>, by Simon Winchester<br>Although I found the first few chapters of this book to be a little boring and slow, the last several chapters are wonderful and insightful. If you have an interest in the history of navigation, time keeping and how modern scientific measurements have influenced our lives, this book is worth the time to read.</p><p><strong>14. The Stars</strong>, by H.A.Rey<br>This book is amazing! Yes, it is written by author of the many popular Curious George books. If you have any interest in the stars and celestial mechanics, you need this book. The drawings and diagrams are incredibly insightful. The sections on the celestial sphere, orbits and the seasons are easy to read and understand. Buy this book!</p><p><strong>15. Ultralearning</strong>, by James Young<br>An interesting book with some insightful stories and lessong about people that have mastered a topic or skill thorugh intense effort combined with ability. Like many books written around self imrpovement, some sections are repedetive and too verbose. However, it is not difficult to quickly scan these sections. Worth a quick read if you are interested in learning a something challenging and are not sure how to start.</p><p><strong>16. On Tyranny</strong>, by Timothy Snyder<br>A short read with some interesting insights and historical information regarding fascism and communist tyranny. The author spends too much time comparing the outcome of the 2016 election and president elect to the rise of fascism, but when he stays on topic the reading is insightful. I recommend this book for the historical information only.</p><p><strong>17. Ice Age</strong>, by John and Mary Gribbin<br>If you are interested in the scientific theories and experiments developed over the past century in order to better understand the long term history of Earth&rsquo;s climate, then you will enjoy this book.</p><p><strong>18. How To Fly A Horse</strong>, by Kevin Ashton<br>A fun book about the history of invention and discovery. Some chapters will be more interesting than others depending on your interests and background.</p><p><strong>19. Chasing the Demon</strong>, by Dan Hampton<br>An interesting book about aviation history and the milestones that led up to flying faster than the speed of sound. The book also includes some interesting photographs from the post WWII era when secret flight tests were being made in the US.</p><p><strong>20. Rocket Billionaires</strong>, by Tim Fernholz<br>I really enjoyed this book. It includes a readable history of the various commercial space companies led by the well-known billionaires of today. The stories about SpaceX alone are worth the price of the book. Reading this book actually increased my interest in the modern commercial space race and the companies involved.</p><p><strong>21. Zero to One</strong>, by Peter Thiel<br>In my opinion, one of the best startup books out there. Read it!</p><p><strong>22. Lost In The Math</strong>, by Sabine Hossenfelder<br>This is a refreshing look at the progress in particle physics. Sabine is very engaging and brings a new perspective to the topic. She also authors a blog and puts out some really educational YouTube videos.</p><p><strong>23. Unsettled</strong>, by Steven Koonin<br>A very interesting book about the difficulties and uncertainties in the science of climate change. The author is a qualified physicists with many years of experience in the research and the politics behind climate issues. At times the book was a little unorganized, but the content was well worth the time it takes to read.</p><p><strong>24. The Hunter Killers</strong>, by Dan Hampton<br>This is a fascinating book about the Vietnam War and methods used to hunt and destroy SAM missile installations in North Vietnam. Sections of the book are packed with adrenaline infused stories of actual missions. The book has all sorts of interesting information about the strategies and technologies used on both sides. A very enjoyable book!</p><p><strong>25. The Operator</strong>, by Dan Robert O&rsquo;Neill<br>Intense, eye-opening, interesting. Read it!</p><p><strong>26. The Way Of The Knife</strong>, by Mark Mazzetti<br>An eye-opening education about how the CIA and DoD conduct war and how it has evolved over the past 25 years. This book contains an impressive amount of information.</p><p><strong>26. David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants</strong>, by Malcolm Gladwell<br>I know I am late to the party when it comes to this book, but I finally got around to reading it and must admit that is was interesting. The sections about the potential perils for some when selecting a top university were especially interesting. This is an interesting book, even if it sometimes seems to suffer from its own confermation bias.</p><p><strong>27. Titan</strong>, by Ron Chernow<br>A very detailed and interesting book about the life of John D. Rockerfeller, Sr. As an entrepreneur it was educational to read about his life and decision processes. It is a thick book, but the account of post civil war industrial development made this book worth heavy cost of time it took to read. There are also many lessons about business and investing worth learning.</p><p><strong>28. Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future</strong>, by Ashlee Vance<br>This is a good book that will both excite and distrurb the reader. I found it interesting and insightful as an entrepreneur. It was especially useful in triggering deeper thinking about what it took for Elon to be succesful at extremely large efforts. Both the good and bad are layed bare in the book.</p><p><strong>29. Einstein: His Life and Universe</strong>, by Walter Isaacson<br>I really enjoyed this biography. In addition to some nice sections on physics, I leared several new things about Eistein the person. It was interesting to learn that he made and published mistakes, struggled with several relationships, and resisted the interpretations of Quantum Mechanics held by other famous physicists.</p><p><strong>30. Grant</strong>, by Ron Chernow<br>This is a very impressive book. It took me a lot of time to complete, but I leanred a lot about both Grant and the Civil War era that I did not previously know. I came away with a greater appreciation for Grant and the struggles he faced during his lifetime. I also gained a better appreciation for that very important time in US history. Read this book!</p><p><strong>30. Steve Jobs</strong>, by Walter Isaacson<br>I read this over the winter months in late 2021. It was really interesting to read about Steve Jobs youth and family life. His path to success is unique along with his approach to life. I enjoyed learning more about the beginnings of Apple and the people involved. Steve certainly has some flawes as a person, but he was a force for innovation. The book starts to get a little too detailed and long in the second half. I admit to skipping a few sections that I did not find very interesting. Overall, this is a good book and worth the investment in time to read.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><p class="small text-center text-muted w-75 mx-auto">&copy 2012–2025 OhmDSP Site&nbsp;⋅
